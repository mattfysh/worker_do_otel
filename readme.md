# docker usage

Uses local miniflare, as wrangler dev is unable to connect to local redis instance

```
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

While running local environment, running `pnpm build` will rebuild & restart the worker inside the container

Run tests from outside the container with `curl http://localhost:7000`
